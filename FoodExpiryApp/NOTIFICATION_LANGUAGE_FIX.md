# Notification Language Fix

## Problem
Notifications in the FoodExpiryApp were only displaying in English, regardless of the user's language settings. The app supports English, Chinese, and Japanese through the LanguageContext, but the NotificationService was using hardcoded English strings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. NotificationService.ts Updates

**Added Language Support:**
- Imported `DeviceEventEmitter` to listen for language changes
- Added `Language` type definition for type safety
- Created comprehensive translation mappings for all notification strings in all supported languages (English, Chinese, Japanese)
- Added `currentLanguage` property to track the current language
- Added `loadLanguage()` method to load the current language from AsyncStorage
- Added `t()` method for translation with placeholder replacement
- Added `updateLanguage()` method to refresh language when it changes
- Added `setupLanguageListener()` method to listen for language change events

**Updated Notification Methods:**
- `scheduleExpiryNotification()` - Now uses translated strings for all notification titles and bodies
- `scheduleTestNotification()` - Uses translated test notification messages  
- `scheduleDailyFoodCheck()` - Uses translated daily check messages
- `sendFoodSummaryNotification()` - Uses translated summary messages

**Key Changes:**
- All hardcoded English strings replaced with `this.t(key, replacements)`
- Dynamic content like quantity, days, and location properly formatted for each language
- Proper plural handling for different languages
- Number values converted to strings for placeholder replacement

### 2. SimpleNotificationService.ts Updates

**Enhanced Language Support:**
- Added Japanese translations to the existing translation system
- Updated emoji icons for consistency with NotificationService
- Added `DeviceEventEmitter` import and language change listener
- Improved translation consistency across both services

## Translation Keys Added

### English (en)
```
notification.testTitle: "🍎 Food Expiry Alert"
notification.testBody: "This is a test notification from Expiry Alert!"
notification.expiringTodayTitle: "🚨 Food Expiring Today!"
notification.expiringSoonTitle: "⚠️ Food Expiring Soon"
notification.expiredTitle: "❌ Food Has Expired"
// ... and more
```

### Chinese (zh)
```
notification.testTitle: "🍎 食品过期警报"
notification.testBody: "这是一个测试通知，来自过期警报！"
notification.expiringTodayTitle: "🚨 今天过期的食品！"
notification.expiringSoonTitle: "⚠️ 即将过期的食品"
notification.expiredTitle: "❌ 食品已过期"
// ... and more
```

### Japanese (ja)
```
notification.testTitle: "🍎 食品期限警報"
notification.testBody: "これは過期警報からのテスト通知です！"
notification.expiringTodayTitle: "🚨 今日期限切れの食品！"
notification.expiringSoonTitle: "⚠️ 期限切れ間近の食品"
notification.expiredTitle: "❌ 食品が期限切れ"
// ... and more
```

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** When the app starts, the NotificationService loads the current language from AsyncStorage
2. **Language Changes:** When users change language in settings, a `languageChanged` event is emitted
3. **Event Listening:** NotificationService listens for this event and updates its current language
4. **Dynamic Translation:** When creating notifications, the service uses the `t()` method to get the appropriate translated string
5. **Placeholder Replacement:** Dynamic content (names, quantities, days) is properly inserted into translated templates

## Benefits

- ✅ Notifications now display in the user's selected language
- ✅ Consistent experience across the entire app
- ✅ Proper localization for Chinese and Japanese text
- ✅ Dynamic language switching without app restart
- ✅ Maintained emoji support for better visual appeal
- ✅ Type-safe implementation with proper error handling

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Change language in app settings
2. Send a test notification from notification settings
3. Add/edit food items and verify expiry notifications
4. Check that notifications appear in the selected language

The notifications will now properly reflect the user's language choice and update immediately when the language is changed.
