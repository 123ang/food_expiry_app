# Google Drive Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Drive integration for your Expiry Alert app to store food item images.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - Visit [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a New Project** (or use existing)
   - Click "Select a project" dropdown
   - Click "NEW PROJECT"
   - Name: `expiry-alert-app`
   - Click "CREATE"

3. **Enable Google Drive API**
   - In the left sidebar, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Drive API"
   - Click on it and click "ENABLE"

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID"
   - If prompted, configure OAuth consent screen first (see below)
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: `Expiry Alert Web App`
   - Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/google` (for development)
     - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/google` (for production)
   - Click "CREATE"
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. OAuth Consent Screen Configuration

1. **Go to OAuth consent screen**
   - In "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - User Type: "External" (unless you have Google Workspace)
   - Click "CREATE"

2. **App Information**
   - App name: `Expiry Alert`
   - User support email: Your email
   - Developer contact information: Your email
   - Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"

3. **Scopes**
   - Click "ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES"
   - Add: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
   - This allows the app to create and manage files it creates
   - Click "UPDATE" and "SAVE AND CONTINUE"

4. **Test users** (for development)
   - Add your email and any test users
   - Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE"

### 3. Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Google Drive Integration
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Existing Firebase config (keep these)
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
```

### 4. Test the Integration

1. **Start your development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Add a new food item**
   - Go to Dashboard > Add Item
   - Fill in the form details
   - Click "Choose Image" in the new image upload section
   - You'll be prompted to authenticate with Google
   - Grant permissions to access Google Drive
   - Upload an image

3. **Verify in Google Drive**
   - Go to [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com)
   - Look for "Expiry Alert Images" folder
   - Your uploaded image should be there

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### File Organization
- Creates a dedicated "Expiry Alert Images" folder in Google Drive
- All food item images are stored in this folder
- Images are made publicly viewable (with direct link)
- Automatic image compression before upload

### Image Features
- **Compression**: Images are automatically compressed to reduce storage
- **Thumbnails**: Google Drive provides thumbnails for faster loading
- **Public URLs**: Images get shareable URLs for display in the app
- **Organization**: All images are neatly organized in one folder

### Data Storage
Food items now include:
- `imageId`: Google Drive file ID
- `imageUrl`: Public view URL
- `imageThumbnail`: Thumbnail URL for faster loading

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### For Users
1. **First Time Setup**
   - When first uploading an image, users authenticate with Google
   - Permission is requested only once
   - Authentication persists across sessions

2. **Uploading Images**
   - Click "Choose Image" when adding/editing food items
   - Images are automatically compressed and uploaded
   - Progress indicator shows upload status
   - Preview appears immediately after upload

3. **Managing Images**
   - Replace images by uploading new ones
   - Remove images if not needed
   - Images are automatically deleted from Google Drive when removed

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

### What We Access
- **Limited Scope**: Only `drive.file` scope (files created by the app)
- **No Full Access**: Cannot see or modify other Google Drive files
- **User Control**: Users can revoke access anytime in Google account settings

### Data Privacy
- Images are stored in user's own Google Drive
- No images stored on our servers
- Users maintain full control over their data
- Can delete images anytime from Google Drive

## ðŸš€ Deployment Considerations

### Production Setup
1. **Update OAuth Settings**
   - Add your production domain to authorized origins
   - Add production redirect URI
   - Update environment variables for production

2. **Domain Verification**
   - For published apps, verify your domain in Google Cloud Console
   - Required for non-localhost production URLs

### Scaling
- Google Drive API has generous quotas
- For high-volume apps, consider Google Cloud Storage instead
- Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access denied" or "Permission denied"**
   - Check OAuth consent screen configuration
   - Ensure correct scopes are added
   - Verify redirect URIs match exactly

2. **"Invalid client" error**
   - Double-check Client ID in environment variables
   - Ensure client is configured for web application
   - Check authorized domains

3. **Images not displaying**
   - Check if images are public (should be automatic)
   - Verify image URLs are being saved correctly
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Upload failures**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify file size (max 10MB recommended)
   - Check file type (images only)

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by adding to your environment:
```env
REACT_APP_DEBUG_GOOGLE_DRIVE=true
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

### Google Cloud Console
- Monitor API usage in "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard"
- Check quotas and limits
- View error logs if issues occur

### App Analytics
- Upload success/failure rates
- Image storage usage
- User authentication flow completion

## ðŸ”„ Migration from Firebase Storage

If you were previously using Firebase Storage:

1. **Keep Both Systems** (recommended)
   - New items use Google Drive
   - Existing items keep Firebase URLs
   - Gradual migration as items are edited

2. **Full Migration** (optional)
   - Download existing images from Firebase
   - Re-upload to Google Drive
   - Update database references
   - Clean up Firebase Storage
